# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide for Porto

This file provides essential information for Claude AI (and other AI assistants) working with the Porto codebase.

## Mandatory GitHub Interaction Rules

### Required Tools

1. **GitHub MCP**: `mcp__github__*` functions (authenticated, no rate limits)
2. **GitHub CLI**: `gh` commands (authenticated via CLI)
3. **NEVER**: Direct API calls, web scraping, or unauthenticated requests

### Examples

✅ **Correct**: `mcp__github__get_pull_request` or `gh pr view`
❌ **Wrong**: Direct API calls to `api.github.com`

### Pull Requests

- You are allowed to open pull requests for this repository.
- Always use `mcp__github__create_pull_request` or `gh pr create` to create pull requests.

## Directory Structure

- `apps/`: Applications
- `contracts/`: Contracts
  - The Porto Account contracts are a submodule under the `account/` directory
- `src/`: `porto` library source
  - Files are represented as modules
  - Files (modules) that are not exposed to the public API are stored in an `internal/` directory
- `scripts/`: Development scripts
- `test/`: Test configuration and utilities

## Project Overview

### Library (`src/`)

#### External Dependencies

- **`viem`** - TypeScript Interface for Ethereum
- **`wagmi`** - React Hooks for Ethereum
- **`ox`** - Standard Library for Ethereum
- **`@sinclair/typebox`** - Runtime schema validation

#### Core Modules (`src/core/`)

- **`Chains`** - Supported Porto chains and their configuration (e.g. RPC Server endpoints, chain ID, etc.)
- **`Dialog`** - Dialog instances
- **`Messenger`** - Cross-document communication
- **`Mode`** - Account orchestration mode (e.g. `dialog`, `rpcServer`, `contract`)
- **`Storage`** - Storage interfaces
- **`RpcSchema`** - RPC method schemas and types
- Internal modules are stored in an `internal/` directory

#### Viem Modules (`src/viem/`)

- **`Account`** - Viem Account abstraction for Porto Accounts
- **`Key`** - Account key management and cryptographic operations (e.g. `secp256k1`, `p256`, `webauthn-p256`)
- **`ContractActions`** - Actions for the Ithaca Account contract.
- **`ServerActions`** - Actions for the RPC Server
- **`ServerClient`** - Client helpers for the RPC Server
- **`WalletActions`** - Actions for the Porto Dialog (EIP-1193 Provider)

#### Wagmi Modules (`src/wagmi/`)

- **`Query`** - Wagmi Query utilities

### Applications (`apps/`)

- **`playground/`** - Development playground
- **`id/`** - Account management application (`id.porto.sh`)
- **`faucet/`** - Fee token faucet worker (for development)
- **`wagmi/`** - Wagmi development playground
- **`verify/`** - Application verification worker

### Contracts (`contracts/`)

- **`account/`** - Core account abstraction contracts
- **`demo/`** - Demo and example contracts

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**: Against `main`, named `claude/feature-name`
2. **Develop features**: Ensure to add any relevant tests for new functionality
3. **Run tests**: `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:browser`
4. **Check code quality**: `pnpm check`
5. **Build and validate**: `pnpm build && pnpm check:build`
6. **Add changeset**: If any public API or behavioral changes were made to the library (`src/`), add a changeset with `pnpm changeset`. Changesets should use past tense verbs (e.g. `Added new feature`). Any breaking changes should be noted with a `**Breaking:**` prefix with a description of how to migrate.
7. **Submit a PR**: Ensure PR title is in conventional commit format (e.g. `feat: add new feature`) and PR description is detailed

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit/Integration Tests**: Vitest with coverage reporting
- **Browser/E2E Tests**: Vitest Browser mode (Playwright with Chromium, Firefox and WebKit).

### PR Requirements

- All tests must pass (`pnpm test && pnpm test:browser`)
- Code must be properly formatted (`pnpm check`)
- Types must be valid (`pnpm check:types`)
- Build must succeed (`pnpm build`)
- Bundle size limits must be respected (`pnpm check:size`)
- No unused dependencies (`pnpm check:knip`)

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working with this repository, AI assistants should follow these additional guidelines:

### Documentation Writing Style

When writing or editing documentation files, follow these style guidelines:

#### Voice and Perspective

##### Use Third Person for Technical Documentation

- ✅ "The Porto SDK is a TypeScript library designed for Applications and Wallets"
- ✅ "Porto can be used in conjunction with Wagmi"
- ✅ "This will internally inject a Porto instance"
- ❌ "We designed Porto to..." or "Our SDK allows you to..."

##### Use Second Person for Instructions

When giving direct instructions to developers, use second person:

- ✅ "You can get started with Porto by creating a new instance"
- ✅ "After you have set up Wagmi, you can set up Porto"

##### Avoid First Person

Never use "we," "our," or "I" in technical documentation:

- ❌ "We implemented it, ran it for weeks..."
- ✅ "PREP was implemented and ran for a number of weeks"
- ❌ "we don't want to think about it"
- ✅ "this adds unnecessary complexity"
- ❌ "We do not really care about..."
- ✅ "The provable resource-lock capabilities are not prioritized..."

#### Examples

**Before (First Person):**

```markdown
We implemented PREP and ran it for weeks, evaluated the pros/cons and we didn't think it was worth it. We replaced it with an ephemeral private key approach.
```

**After (Third Person):**

```markdown
PREP was implemented and ran for a number of weeks. After evaluating the pros/cons, it was decided that the pattern did not meet the needs of the Porto Stack. It was replaced with an ephemeral private key approach.
```

#### Additional Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Maintain technical accuracy while improving readability
- Reference specific code with inline formatting or code blocks
- Include relevant file paths and line numbers when applicable
- Use passive voice when appropriate to maintain objectivity

### PR Review Comments

- **Always wrap PR review comments in `<details>` tags** that are closed by default
- Use descriptive summary text in the `<summary>` tag
- This improves PR browsability by allowing users to easily scan through activity without long review comments cluttering the view

Example format:

```html
<details>
<summary>🔍 Code Review: [Brief description]</summary>

[Your detailed review comments here]

</details>
```

This file should be updated when major architectural changes are made to the codebase.
