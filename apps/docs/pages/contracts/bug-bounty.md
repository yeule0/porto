## Bug Bounty

We're opening up a live bug bounty program to encourage responsible security research and battle-test our contracts in the real world. We’re inviting white hat hackers, tinkerers, and security researchers to probe our account implementation.

### Capture the Funds

- **Porto smart account** deployed on Base mainnet, funded with **1 ETH**
