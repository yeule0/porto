## Announcing Developer Preview

<ChangelogDate date="2025-05-28" />

![Developer Preview](./porto-dev.png)

[Porto](https://ithaca.xyz/updates/porto) is our open source [TypeScript library](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto) which gives accounts the superpowers to answer these two questions. Today, we are releasing the [Porto Developer Preview](https://porto.sh), and we are excited to share that Porto is live on Base Sepolia, and coming soon to every EVM chain in production.

With Porto, you can create new accounts or upgrade existing ones by plugging into your preferred authentication layer, WebAuthn via Passkeys, or OAuth via Privy. No passwords, apps, seed phrases, private keys, or browser extensions needed.

Porto connects authentication with powerful execution capabilities⁠, solving some of the hardest problems that have haunted crypto application developers for the last years around onboarding, transacting on multiple chains, and paying predictable fees in stablecoins.

Our core principles:

- **Developer-first:** Porto works seamlessly with [Wagmi](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi) and [Viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem), the most widely used web3 frontend libraries, without any code changes.
- **Performance & cost-effectiveness:** Porto is powered by a  [reimagined account abstraction stack](https://porto.sh/contracts), which is [>50% more gas efficient](https://porto.sh/contracts/benchmarks) on payments than alternatives, and offers state of the art transaction latency.
- **Modularity:** Porto works standalone or headless, letting you enjoy the benefits of the Porto stack without changing any of the flows your users and developers love!.

Beyond crypto applications, we think Porto works well with: traditional passkey setups, existing key management systems, and crypto wallets.
